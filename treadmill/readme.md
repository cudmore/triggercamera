This is documentation for controlling a behavioral experiment using an Arduino microcontroller with a Python based web interface. First, we document building an Arduino controlled motorized circular treadmill. Next, we provide Python source code to control an experiment through a web-browser. Our aim is to provide a starting point for open-source behavioral experiments that can be extended to new experimental designs.
